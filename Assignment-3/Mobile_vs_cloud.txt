---------------------------------------------------------------------

Mobile Computing :

1) Mobile computing is the ability to use computing capability without a pre-defined location and/or connection to a network to publish and/or subscribe to information.

2) Clients are the mobile devices such as laptops, mobile phones.

3) Not disturbuted. Hence mobile computing using web hosted serves will lost information on server damage.

4) Screens and keyboards tend to be small, which may make them hard to use. Alternate input methods such as speech or handwriting recognition require training.

5) As the communication medium works on common protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP. Each device supports this features as pre-requisite.


Cloud Computing :

1) Cloud Computing is the ability to run a program or application on many connected computers(Individual virtual instance) at the same time over Internet.

2) Clients are the devices which are connected through a communication network such as Internet.

3) Are distributed and clustered, hence if one virtual server goes down, the daemon process trigger a new instance with same functionalities.

4) By minimizing user involvement, automation speeds up the process and reduces the possibility of human errors.

5) Each cloud systems uses different protocols and different APIs, as a result may not be possible to run applications between cloud based systems
